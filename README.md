## Inspiration

The COVID-19 pandemic and other economic challenges have hit local businesses hard. This platform was inspired by the need to provide a decentralized, innovative, and community-driven method to support these critical pillars of local economies.

## What It Does

_NFT4Local_:
1. Allows businesses to mint NFTs representing future services or products.
2. Enables community members to purchase these NFTs, providing immediate financial support.
3. Offers an option for NFT holders to redeem their tokens for actual services or products once the business is stable.
4. Promotes long-term customer relationships through tokens of commitment.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users interact with the platform by connecting their digital wallets.
2. **Strategy Selection**: Choose between supporting a local business or creating an NFT for one.
3. **Support or Create**: Either browse and buy existing NFTs or mint new ones with specific details.
4. **Transaction Confirmation**: All actions require wallet confirmation for security and transparency.
5. **Token of Support**: Minted NFTs serve as tokens of commitment, which can later be redeemed or burned after availing the service or product.
